In this exercise we will investigate how to access private and protected methods and variables from other classes.

To be able to access the results of private methods/variables, in the same class where these are defined we will
need to define public setter and getter methods that will allow us to retrieve results from another class.

Protected methods/variables can be accessed from other classes, if these classes are an extension of the class
where these methods/variables are defined.

Public methods/variables can always be accessed.

Setters are methods that just run other private methods.

Getters are methods with a return statement returning a given variable that might be private, protected or public.
