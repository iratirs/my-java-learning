In the exercise we define static and non-static methods both in the class Methods and in the Main class to be called
from within the main method of the Main class.

//to call a static method from another class
ClassName.methodName();

//to call a static method from the same class
methodName();

//to call a non-static method from another class
ClassName obj = new ClassName();
obj.methodName();

//to call a non-static method from Main class
Main obj = new Main();
obj.methodName();
