ArrayList - can repeat values.
    In MyArrayList I show how to loop through built-in arrays and ArrayLists.
    In FixedToDynamic I show how to add to an ArrayList and immutable built-in array after converting it with package Arrays.

Print methods:
    While loop - MyArrayList
    For-each loop - MyMap + FixedToDynamic
    For loop backwards - MyArrayList
    Iterator - MyHashSet
